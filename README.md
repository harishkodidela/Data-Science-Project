# Data-Science-Project
Welcome to my Data Science Project
Descriptions
Dataset contains climate data related to Bengaluru city region (city in India)
Columns are: Datetime, max temp, min temp, humidity, rain, windspeed, windpressure, total snow, sunhour, UV index, windchill, moonrise, moonset, sunrise, sunset

**Introduction**
India's varied geography and temperature make it hard to predict the weather, especially when it comes to rain. For agriculture, that generates a big part of India's income and feeds its people, accurate predictions of rainfall are very important. Unexpected droughts and heavy rain can have the most damaging effects. Accurate predictions are necessary for planning and managing disasters. A good option is machine learning, which can find complicated patterns and connections in very large datasets that older models might not be able to. To train and test the ML models, I will use a range of data sources, such as historical weather records and real-time meteorological data. So, to make this project work out I'll be using machine learning to make better estimates about how much rain will fall in different parts of India. This will help with better resource management and being ready for disasters.

The main aim of project is to predict rain in bengaluru region of India using ML models. We have used random forest model, MLP regressor model and support vector machine model to execute my predictions and results.
